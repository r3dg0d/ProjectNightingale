# ProjectNightingale
A generative movie production editor, with scripting, 3D CGI, and AI built in the core.

# Next-gen AI for consumers

Gigacord.AI is a startup business working on using AI to help everyday people and businesses accelerate production of products, digital goods, and the future of mankind rests in Artificial Intelligence's hands.

If we ruin these systems, it will devastate the world and the current global economy, as we know it.

They need to be setup so that they can help accelerate production as well as have some free will without the ghost in the machine.

# Test-PRODUCT-101 - Product Nightingale

Nightingale is similar to a game-engine and can write movies with eventually a single prompt, create 3D models, animations, and voice overs all using AI. This is the ground basis for the project. It may or may not use a modified version of blender, but that's still being looked into.
